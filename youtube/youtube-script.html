        <span class="slide-title">Your Entire Family Should Know About Your Investments</span>
      </div>
      <div class="script-text">
        <p>Hi everyone, welcome to Capital Friends.</p>
        <p>Before I start, let me be honest with you. I am not a regular YouTuber. I make videos only about this app and some useful tips. I am also not a financial advisor, so nothing in this video is financial advice. And sorry if my English is not very good. I will try my best to keep it simple.</p>
        <p>OK, so let me ask you one question. <span class="highlight">Does your family know about all your money?</span> Your bank accounts, your investments, your insurance?</p>
        <p>Most people say "No." And that is a very big problem.</p>
        <p>Capital Friends is a free web app that helps your family know everything about your money. It is free forever. Your family stays informed. And your data stays completely private.</p>
        <p>Let me explain.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- SLIDE 2 -->
    <div class="slide">
      <div class="slide-header">
        <span class="slide-number">SLIDE 2</span>
        <span class="slide-title">Hidden Danger</span>
      </div>
      <div class="script-text">
        <p>Think about this. You have so many things in your head. Bank accounts, investments, properties, important documents.</p>
        <p>But <span class="highlight">what if something happens to you tomorrow?</span> Does your wife know which bank you use? Do your parents know where your mutual funds are? Do your children know about your property papers?</p>
        <p>All this information is hidden inside your head. And that is the hidden danger. If your family does not know, they can lose everything.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- SLIDE 3 -->
    <div class="slide">

        <span class="slide-title">Existing Solutions</span>
      </div>
      <div class="script-text">
        <p>Now you might say, "There are already apps for this." Yes, there are. But look at the problems.</p>
        <p>First, most of them are <span class="highlight">paid</span>. You have to pay every month or every year.</p>
        <p>Second, you need <span class="highlight">many different apps</span>. One for mutual funds, one for stocks, one for insurance. Too many apps.</p>
        <p>Third, <span class="highlight">no app sends alerts to your family</span>. Your family has no idea what is happening.</p>
        <p>Fourth, <span class="highlight">privacy is a big concern</span>. You are giving your financial data to some company. You don't know what they do with it.</p>
        <p>And fifth, <span class="highlight">no reminders</span>. Nobody tells you "Hey, your insurance is expiring next week."</p>
        <p>So the existing solutions are not complete.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="script-text">
        <p>This is where Capital Friends comes in.</p>
        <p>It is very simple. You sign in with your Google account. You share your financial information. Your family knows about it. It is a modern web app, but all your data stays in your own Google Drive. Nobody else can see it. Not even me.</p>
        <p><span class="highlight">You share. Family knows. Your app. Your data.</span> That's it.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="slide-header">
        <span class="slide-number">SLIDE 5</span>
        <span class="slide-title">What Capital Friends Does</span>
      </div>
      <div class="slide-note">Show the web app live — walk through the pages and features</div>
      <div class="script-text">
        <p>Now let me show you the actual app. When you sign in at capitalfriends.in with your Google account, this is what you see. A clean, modern dashboard with a sidebar that takes you to every section. It works on your phone, tablet, or computer. Let me walk you through everything.</p>

        <p><span class="feature-name">First, the Initial Setup.</span> When you sign in for the first time, the app automatically creates a private Google Sheet in your own Google Drive. This sheet is yours — it stores all your financial data. The app is just a beautiful dashboard to view and manage this data. You don't have to do anything. One sign-in and everything is set up.</p>

        <p><span class="feature-name">Financial Health Check.</span> This is a small questionnaire right inside the app. It asks you simple questions — do you have health insurance? Do you have term insurance? Do you have a will? Do you have emergency fund? Based on your answers, it gives you a score. It tells you what is missing. I will talk about these questions later in this video.</p>

        <p><span class="feature-name">Dashboard.</span> This is the home page. It shows your complete family wealth in one screen. Total wealth, total liabilities, net worth, how your money is divided between equity, debt, and gold. Market cap allocation — large cap, mid cap, small cap. Everything in one beautiful view.</p>

        <p><span class="feature-name">Email Reports.</span> This is the best part. The app sends a complete wealth report email to your entire family. The email has everything — total wealth, each person's investments, profit and loss, bank accounts, insurance, mutual fund holdings with current NAV, all-time high tracking. You can set it to send daily, weekly, or monthly automatically. Your family always knows the complete picture.</p>

        <p><span class="feature-name">Email Settings.</span> In the Settings page, you can set the time and how often the email goes. Daily at 9 AM? Weekly on Monday? Monthly on 1st? You choose.</p>

        <p><span class="feature-name">Goals.</span> This is a very powerful feature. You have a Goal Planner wizard that helps you plan for retirement, emergency fund, house purchase, child education, child marriage, car — any goal you want. It calculates the exact monthly SIP you need. Or if you have some lumpsum money right now, it tells you how much to invest as lumpsum and how much SIP for the remaining. You can also see the Goals page to track all your goals, how much progress you made. There is even a Withdrawal Planning feature — when you reach your goal, it tells you how to take the money out.</p>

        <p><span class="feature-name">Family Members.</span> This page is where you add everyone in your family. Your wife, parents, children, anyone who should know about your money. Their name, email, phone, PAN, Aadhar — everything in one place. If something happens to you, your family has all the details they need.</p>

        <p><span class="feature-name">Bank Accounts.</span> Add all your bank accounts. Savings, current, any bank. Your family will know which banks you use and what accounts you have.</p>

        <p><span class="feature-name">Investment Accounts.</span> Your Demat accounts, mutual fund platforms like Groww, Zerodha, Kuvera — add all of them here. So your family knows where your investments are.</p>

        <p><span class="feature-name">Mutual Funds.</span> This is a big one. You can create portfolios, set target allocation for each fund, buy via SIP, buy lumpsum, sell, switch between funds. The app tracks everything — current NAV, units, invested amount, current value, profit and loss. It even shows all-time high NAV so you know how far below the peak you are. And the best part — portfolio rebalancing. You set your target, like 60% equity 40% debt. If the market moves and your allocation changes, it tells you exactly how much to invest where to bring it back to your plan. It even shows rebalanced SIP and rebalanced lumpsum amounts. There is also Fund Composition Breakdown that shows you how much of your money is in large cap, mid cap, small cap.</p>

        <p><span class="feature-name">Stocks.</span> Create stock portfolios, buy stocks, sell stocks. It tracks your holdings, all transactions, profit and loss. Live prices come from Google Finance. The stock database has more than 5000 NSE stocks.</p>

        <p><span class="feature-name">Other Investments.</span> This is for everything else. Gold, real estate, PPF, EPF, NPS, fixed deposits, bonds, crypto, or any custom type you want. Add it here.</p>

        <p><span class="feature-name">Liabilities.</span> Track all your loans and debts. Home loan, car loan, personal loan, education loan, credit card, gold loan, business loan — everything. So you know your complete picture — assets minus liabilities equals your real net worth.</p>

        <p><span class="feature-name">Insurance.</span> Add all your insurance policies. Health insurance, term insurance, life insurance, motor insurance. Policy number, sum insured, premium, expiry date — everything tracked.</p>

        <p><span class="feature-name">Reminders.</span> This is very useful. Set reminders for insurance renewal, SIP payment, EMI due date, tax filing deadline, credit card bill, portfolio review, or any custom reminder. It sends you email alerts before the due date so you never miss anything.</p>

        <p>So that is everything Capital Friends does. All in one free web app. No downloads, no subscription. Your data stays in your own Google Drive. Private and secure.</p>

        <p>Now the biggest question. Why is this free?</p>
        <p><span class="highlight">Number 1</span> — I built this for my own family. I could not find any tool that gives both privacy and transparency. So I built one.</p>
        <p><span class="highlight">Number 2</span> — Every family needs this. Not just rich people. Every single family.</p>
        <p><span class="highlight">Number 3</span> — Your data is in your Google Drive. I cannot see anything. There are zero server costs for me. So there is nothing to charge for.</p>
        <p><span class="highlight">Number 4</span> — There is no storage cost, no access cost. The app runs on your Google account.</p>
        <p><span class="highlight">Number 5</span> — No subscriptions. Not now, not ever. Completely free, always.</p>
        <p><span class="highlight">Number 6</span> — The mission is simple. Help every family. That's it.</p>

        <span class="slide-title">Do You Have Health Insurance?</span>
      </div>
      <div class="script-text">
        <p>Now let me ask you some important questions. Please think honestly.</p>
        <p>Number one. <span class="highlight">Do you have health insurance?</span></p>
        <p>One hospital visit today can cost 5 lakh, 10 lakh, or even 20 lakh rupees. A major surgery or cancer treatment can cost 30 to 50 lakh. Without health insurance, all the money you saved for years can disappear in just a few months.</p>
        <p>And the most important thing — the younger you buy health insurance, the cheaper it is. If you wait till you are older or if you get some health problem, the same plan costs double or triple. Some companies might even reject you. So buy when you are young and healthy.</p>
        <p>I will tell you about myself. I am 41 years old. I have health insurance for my full family. I pay less than 4 thousand rupees per month. My base cover is 1 crore and the plan gives 5 times coverage — that means up to 5 crore protection. All this for less than 4 thousand per month. If I had taken this same plan at age 30, it would have been even cheaper. And if I wait till 50, it will cost much more.</p>
        <p>Think about it. Less than 4 thousand per month. And your family is protected up to 5 crore. Without this, one medical emergency can destroy everything you built in your entire life.</p>
        <p>Please get health insurance if you don't have it. It is the first step of financial planning.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="script-text">
        <p>Number two. <span class="highlight">Do you have term insurance?</span></p>
        <p>If something happens to you, who will take care of your family? Your EMIs, your children's school fees, daily expenses — everything needs money.</p>
        <p>Term insurance is very cheap. For a 1 crore cover, you pay only 10,000 to 15,000 rupees per year. That's about 1,000 rupees per month. Less than what you spend on eating out.</p>
        <p>Without term insurance, your family's financial safety disappears when you are gone. Please get it today.</p>

      <div class="script-text">
        <p>Number three. <span class="highlight">Do you have an emergency fund?</span></p>
        <p>What if you lose your job? What if there is a medical emergency? What if something breaks in your house?</p>
        <p>Without emergency funds, you will be forced to sell your investments at a loss. Keep at least 6 months of expenses in a savings account or liquid fund. If your monthly expenses are 50,000 rupees, keep 3 lakh rupees aside. This is your safety net.</p>
        <p>Capital Friends has a Goal Planner that helps you calculate your exact emergency fund amount. Use it.</p>
