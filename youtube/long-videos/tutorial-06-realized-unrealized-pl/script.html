  <div class="yt-desc">Most investors confuse paper profit with real profit. This video explains: Unrealized P&L (paper profit on holdings you still own) vs Realized P&L (actual money you took out). And why switching funds is NOT realized profit — your money is still in the market!

Capital Friends tracks both separately with exact math.

    <p class="action">[TITLE CARD: Realized vs Unrealized P&L — When Did You Actually Make Money? | FREE Portfolio Tracker Web App]</p>

    <p style="color:#888;font-size:12px;"><i>In previous videos we created portfolios, migrated holdings, and recorded all transaction types — SIP, lumpsum, sell, and switch. Now let's understand when you actually made money.</i></p>

    <p>Hi everyone. You buy mutual funds, you sell them, you switch between them. But <span class="hl">when did you actually make money?</span> Most people don't know the answer.</p>

    <p class="subsection">WHAT WE'LL COVER</p>
    <p>1. Unrealized P&L — paper profit on holdings you still own</p>
    <p>2. Realized P&L — actual profit you took out</p>
    <p>3. Why switching funds is NOT realized profit</p>
    <p>4. AllPortfolios — 6 P&L columns explained</p>
    <p>5. Transaction History — gain/loss tracking</p>
    <p>Let me explain.</p>

    <p class="subsection">LIVE DEMO</p>

    <p>Most people look at their portfolio showing +₹13,000 profit and think they made ₹13,000. But did you? You did not take that money out. It is still invested. Tomorrow if the market crashes, that ₹13,000 can become -₹5,000. That is the difference between <span class="hl">unrealized</span> and <span class="hl">realized</span> profit.</p>

    <p class="subsection">UNREALIZED P&L — PAPER PROFIT</p>

    <p class="action">[Show PFL-Retirement sheet — Column P]</p>
    <p>Column P in your portfolio shows P&L for each fund. This is <span class="hl">unrealized P&L</span> — paper profit. You have not sold these funds. The profit exists only on paper.</p>

    <p>If Current NAV goes up tomorrow → your unrealized profit increases.</p>
    <p>If Current NAV crashes tomorrow → your unrealized profit decreases or becomes a loss.</p>

    <p class="action">[Explain: Unrealized P&L = Current Value minus your Investment. It is simply what your holdings are worth today minus what you paid for them]</p>

    <p>This changes every day as NAV changes. That is why it is called "unrealized" — you have not realized (collected) this money yet.</p>

    <p class="subsection">REALIZED P&L — ACTUAL PROFIT</p>

    <p>Realized P&L is the profit or loss on money you <span class="hl">actually took out</span> of the market. You sold, money came to your bank account, done. That profit is real — the market cannot take it away.</p>

    <p>Let's say you sold some units of a fund. You bought at a certain average NAV and sold at a higher NAV. That difference — the profit per unit times the units sold — is your <span class="hl">realized profit</span>.</p>
    <p class="action">[Point to a sell transaction — explain: sold at higher NAV than avg buy price = profit. This profit is real money in your bank]</p>

    <p>This is <span class="hl">real money</span>. It came to my bank. Market can crash 50% tomorrow — my profit is safe.</p>

    <p class="subsection">WHY SWITCH IS NOT REALIZED PROFIT</p>

    <p>This is where most people get confused. Let's say you switched units from Fund A to Fund B. Fund A's avg NAV was lower than the sell NAV, so there is a gain per unit. Looks like profit right?</p>

    <p>But is that a <span class="hl">realized</span> profit? <span style="color:#f66;font-weight:bold;">NO!</span></p>

    <p>The money never left the market. It went from Fund A → Fund B. You are still invested. If the market crashes tomorrow, that "gain" from switching can disappear because Fund B's value will also fall.</p>

    <p>Think of it this way: you moved money from your left pocket to your right pocket. You did not take any money out. <span class="hl">Switch = internal movement, not profit booking.</span></p>

    <p>Capital Friends handles this correctly. The gain from switch is calculated and stored in Transaction History (for your records), but it is <span class="hl">NOT counted in Realized P&L</span>. Only actual withdrawals (money out of the market) count as realized.</p>

    <p class="subsection">ALLPORTFOLIOS — 6 P&L COLUMNS</p>

    <p class="action">[Show AllPortfolios sheet — highlight columns J through O]</p>
    <p>The AllPortfolios sheet has 6 P&L columns:</p>

    <p><span class="fn">Column J: Unrealized P&L ₹</span> — paper profit on holdings you still own</p>
    <p><span class="fn">Column K: Unrealized P&L %</span> — as a percentage</p>
    <p><span class="fn">Column L: Realized P&L ₹</span> — actual profit from withdrawals only</p>
    <p><span class="fn">Column M: Realized P&L %</span> — as a percentage</p>
    <p><span class="fn">Column N: Total P&L ₹</span> — Unrealized + Realized combined</p>
    <p><span class="fn">Column O: Total P&L %</span> — overall return percentage</p>

    <p class="action">[Explain: Total P&L = Current Value minus Total Investment. Realized P&L only counts gains from actual withdrawals (NOT switches). Unrealized = Total minus Realized]</p>

    <p class="subsection">TRANSACTION HISTORY — GAIN/LOSS COLUMN</p>

    <p class="action">[Show TransactionHistory sheet — Column M]</p>
    <p>Every sell transaction (whether withdrawal or switch) records the gain/loss in Column M. This is useful to see your history. But only WITHDRAWAL gains feed into the Realized P&L formula.</p>

    <p>For example:</p>
    <p>• <span style="color:#4f8;">Sell/Withdrawal</span> — gain is counted in Realized P&L (money left the market)</p>
    <p>• <span style="color:#ffd369;">Sell/Switch</span> — gain is NOT counted in Realized P&L (money still in market, just moved to another fund)</p>

    <p class="subsection">REAL EXAMPLE</p>

    <p class="action">[Show AllPortfolios with P&L columns highlighted]</p>
    <p>Let me show you a real example with one of your portfolios.</p>
    <p class="action">[Point to each column as you explain — Total Investment, Current Value, Total P&L, Realized P&L, Unrealized P&L. Show how Total P&L splits into Realized (from withdrawal) and Unrealized (paper profit still in market)]</p>

    <p>The email report also shows both Realized and Unrealized P&L separately. Your family sees the true picture — not just the headline number.</p>

    <p class="subsection">BEST PRACTICES</p>
    <p>1. <span class="hl">Don't celebrate unrealized profits</span> — the market can take them away tomorrow. Only realized profit is real.</p>
    <p>2. <span class="hl">Switching is not profit booking</span> — your money is still at risk in the market. Don't confuse switch gains with real profit.</p>
    <p>3. Check the <span class="hl">Realized P&L column</span> before filing taxes — this is what matters for capital gains tax.</p>
    <p>4. If your unrealized P&L is negative, <span class="hl">don't panic sell</span> — paper losses are temporary if the fund is fundamentally good.</p>
    <p>5. Review P&L quarterly, not daily — checking every day creates unnecessary anxiety.</p>

    <p>Now you understand the real difference between paper profit and real profit. Capital Friends tracks both automatically.
