    <p class="action">[TITLE CARD: Add Family, Banks & Investment Accounts | FREE Portfolio Tracker Web App]</p>

    <p style="color:#888;font-size:12px;"><i>In the previous video we completed the setup — signed in at capitalfriends.in, ran one-click setup, and answered the financial health check. Now let's build the foundation.</i></p>

    <p>Hi everyone. After setup, the first thing — add your family members, bank accounts, and investment accounts. These are the foundation. Everything in Capital Friends is linked to a family member and an account.</p>

    <p class="subsection">WHAT WE'LL COVER</p>
    <p>1. Add family members — name, PAN, Aadhar, email for reports</p>
    <p>2. Add bank accounts — link to family members</p>
    <p>3. Add investment accounts — wherever you invest</p>
    <p>4. Edit and view all — complete family directory</p>
    <p>Let me show you.</p>

    <p class="subsection">LIVE DEMO</p>

    <p class="subsection">FAMILY MEMBERS</p>

    <p class="action">[Click Sidebar → Family Members → Add Member]</p>

    <p>Enter your details — <span class="fn">Name</span>, <span class="fn">Relationship</span> (Self), <span class="fn">PAN</span>, <span class="fn">Aadhar</span>, <span class="fn">Email</span>, <span class="fn">Mobile</span>.</p>
    <p><span class="fn">Include in Email Reports:</span> Yes — very important. Only checked members receive the daily wealth email.</p>
    <p>You can also add custom fields like Date of Birth. Click <span class="fn">Add Member</span>.</p>

    <p class="action">[Show success message, then add spouse as second member]</p>
    <p>Now add your spouse. Same form — select Relationship as Spouse. Make sure <span class="hl">Include in Email Reports = Yes</span> so both of you get the daily email.</p>

    <p><span class="hl">Edit Member:</span></p>
    <p class="action">[Click Family Members → Edit Member]</p>
    <p>If you need to change anything later — phone number, email, address — click <span class="fn">Edit Member</span>. Select the member from dropdown. All fields are pre-filled. Change what you need, click Save.</p>

    <p><span class="hl">View All:</span></p>
    <p class="action">[Click Family Members → View All]</p>
    <p>This shows all family members with their details. Your family can open the app anytime and see everyone's details.</p>

    <p class="subsection">BANK ACCOUNTS</p>

    <p class="action">[Click Sidebar → Bank Accounts → Add Account]</p>

    <p><span class="fn">Account Name:</span> Give it a name you understand (like "Salary Account")</p>
    <p><span class="fn">Family Member:</span> Select from the members we just added</p>
    <p>Enter <span class="fn">Bank Name</span>, <span class="fn">Account Number</span>, <span class="fn">IFSC Code</span>, <span class="fn">Account Type</span>.</p>
    <p>Click <span class="fn">Add Account</span>. Done!</p>

    <p class="action">[Add one more bank account for spouse quickly]</p>

    <p><span class="hl">Edit / View All:</span></p>
    <p class="action">[Click Bank Accounts → Edit Account / View All]</p>
    <p>Same pattern — select from dropdown to edit, or View All to see all bank accounts.</p>

    <p class="subsection">INVESTMENT ACCOUNTS</p>

    <p class="action">[Click Investment Accounts → Add Account]</p>
    <p>Investment accounts are wherever you invest — your broker, your MF platform, your demat account.</p>
    <p>Enter <span class="fn">Account Name</span>, <span class="fn">Family Member</span>, <span class="fn">Linked Bank Account</span> (it shows our bank accounts!), <span class="fn">Account Type</span>, <span class="fn">Platform</span>, <span class="fn">Client ID</span>.</p>
    <p>Click <span class="fn">Add Account</span>. Done!</p>

    <p class="action">[Add one or two more investment accounts quickly — for spouse, or a demat account]</p>

    <p>Now your family knows exactly which banks and platforms you use, and who owns each account. If something happens to you, they know exactly where to look. That is the whole point of Capital Friends.</p>

    <p class="subsection">BEST PRACTICES</p>
    <p>1. Add <span class="hl">all family members</span> — even if they don't invest. Your family needs to know who is who.</p>
    <p>2. Add PAN and Aadhar — when you need to file taxes or claim insurance, these details save hours.</p>
    <p>3. Add <span class="hl">every bank account and investment account</span> — even dormant ones. If something happens to you, your family should not have to guess.</p>
    <p>4. Share access with your spouse right away — they should be able to see everything from day one.</p>
    <p>5. Update whenever something changes — new bank account, new demat, closed account — keep it current.</p>

    <p>That is the foundation. Now you are ready to create portfolios and start tracking investments.
