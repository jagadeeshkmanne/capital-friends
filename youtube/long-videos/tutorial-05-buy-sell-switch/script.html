    <p class="action">[TITLE CARD: Record SIP, Lumpsum, Sell & Switch Transactions | FREE Mutual Fund Tracker Web App]</p>

    <p style="color:#888;font-size:12px;"><i>In previous videos we set up Capital Friends, added family and accounts, created a mutual fund portfolio, and migrated our existing holdings with live NAV tracking. Now let's record transactions.</i></p>

    <p>Hi everyone. Your portfolio is set up. Now every month you invest, sometimes you sell, sometimes you switch. There are 4 transaction types and each affects your portfolio differently.</p>

    <p class="subsection">WHAT WE'LL COVER</p>
    <p>1. Record monthly SIP — and how average NAV updates</p>
    <p>2. Record lumpsum investment — for bonus or dip buying</p>
    <p>3. Sell/Redeem — see your profit before selling!</p>
    <p>4. Switch between funds — why total investment stays the same</p>
    <p>5. Transaction History — all 4 types recorded</p>
    <p>Let me show you all of them.</p>

    <p class="subsection">LIVE DEMO</p>

    <p class="subsection">RECORD MONTHLY SIP</p>

    <p class="action">[Click Sidebar → Mutual Funds → Buy (SIP)]</p>
    <p>See the info box — "SIP Investment — Record your monthly SIP contributions. This will increase your portfolio's Total Investment."</p>

    <p>Select your <span class="fn">Portfolio</span>, <span class="fn">Search Fund</span> (it shows your existing holdings), enter <span class="fn">Purchase Date</span>, <span class="fn">Units Purchased</span> (the new units you got this month), and <span class="fn">Purchase NAV</span> (the NAV at which SIP was processed). Total Amount is auto-calculated. Click <span class="fn">Record SIP Investment</span>.</p>

    <p class="action">[Show portfolio sheet — point to units, avg NAV, and total investment changes]</p>
    <p>See — units increased. And average NAV changed because you bought at a different price. If the market falls and you buy at a lower NAV, your average will come down. This is the power of SIP — <span class="hl">rupee cost averaging</span>.</p>
    <p class="action">[Explain: old investment + new SIP ÷ total units = new average NAV]</p>

    <p>And Total Investment in AllPortfolios also increased — because new money came in.</p>

    <p class="subsection">RECORD LUMPSUM INVESTMENT</p>

    <p>Now let's say I got a bonus at work, or the market fell 10% and I want to invest extra. That is a lumpsum investment.</p>

    <p class="action">[Click Sidebar → Mutual Funds → Buy (Lumpsum)]</p>
    <p>See the info box — "Lumpsum Investment — Record one-time investments. This will increase your portfolio's Total Investment. Use this for bonus/windfall investments, or buying in dips."</p>

    <p>Same form — select your <span class="fn">Portfolio</span>, search for a fund, enter <span class="fn">Date</span>, <span class="fn">Units</span>, <span class="fn">Purchase NAV</span>. Total is auto-calculated. Click <span class="fn">Record Lumpsum Investment</span>.</p>

    <p class="action">[Show portfolio sheet — point to units, avg NAV, and total investment changes]</p>
    <p>Units increased. Average NAV also changed — because you bought at a different price than your earlier average.</p>
    <p class="action">[Explain: old investment + new lumpsum ÷ total units = new average NAV]</p>

    <p>And Total Investment in AllPortfolios increased — because new money came in.</p>

    <p><span class="hl">SIP vs Lumpsum — what's the difference?</span> Both add new units and increase your total investment. The <span class="hl">only difference is the label</span>. SIP is your regular monthly. Lumpsum is one-time. Capital Friends tracks them separately in the <span class="fn">TransactionHistory</span> sheet so you always know which was regular and which was extra.</p>

    <p class="subsection">SELL / REDEEM</p>

    <p>Now the best part — selling. Capital Friends shows your <span class="hl">exact profit or loss before you sell</span>.</p>

    <p class="action">[Click Sidebar → Mutual Funds → Sell/Redeem]</p>
    <p>See the info box — "Redeem/Withdraw — This will DECREASE your portfolio's Total Investment. This is for taking money OUT of your portfolio."</p>

    <p>Select your <span class="fn">Portfolio</span>. <span class="fn">Select Fund</span> — see, it shows a dropdown of funds you own in this portfolio, with current units and avg price.</p>
    <p>Enter <span class="fn">Sale Date</span>, <span class="fn">Units to Redeem</span>, <span class="fn">Sale NAV</span>. Sale Proceeds is auto-calculated.</p>

    <p>Now look at the <span class="hl">Transaction Preview</span> box! This is the best part. It shows your current holdings, average buy price, sale price, remaining units, and the <span class="hl">capital gain or loss</span> — all before you click Sell.</p>
    <p class="action">[Point to preview box — explain: sold at higher price than avg buy price = PROFIT in green. If sold at lower price = LOSS in red]</p>
    <p>You see exactly what you will make <span class="hl">before clicking Sell</span>.</p>

    <p>Click <span class="fn">Sell</span>. Done!</p>

    <p class="action">[Show portfolio sheet]</p>
    <p>Units decreased. But average NAV stays the same — selling does not change your average. Investment adjusted. P&L updated.</p>

    <p>Your Total Investment in AllPortfolios <span class="hl">decreased</span> — because money went OUT of the portfolio. This is the opposite of SIP and Lumpsum which increase it.</p>

    <p class="subsection">SWITCH BETWEEN FUNDS</p>

    <p>Switch is very important to understand. When you sell one fund and buy another inside the same portfolio — your <span class="hl">total investment does not change</span>. You are just moving money from one fund to another.</p>

    <p class="action">[Click Sidebar → Mutual Funds → Switch Funds]</p>
    <p>See the info box — "Switch Funds — This will NOT change your portfolio's Total Investment. It's just moving money internally."</p>

    <p>Select your <span class="fn">Portfolio</span> and <span class="fn">Switch Date</span>.</p>

    <p style="color:#f66;font-weight:bold;">FROM FUND (Selling):</p>
    <p>Select the fund you want to sell from. Enter <span class="fn">Units to Switch</span> and <span class="fn">Sale NAV</span>. Sell amount is auto-calculated.</p>

    <p style="color:#4f8;font-weight:bold;">TO FUND (Buying):</p>
    <p>Search for the fund you want to buy into. Enter <span class="fn">Purchase NAV</span>.</p>
    <p class="action">[Point to the calculated amounts — explain: the sell amount goes entirely into buying the new fund at its NAV]</p>

    <p>Same money, different fund. Not one rupee goes in or out — it just moves internally.</p>

    <p>Click <span class="fn">Switch</span>.</p>

    <p class="action">[Show portfolio sheet]</p>
    <p>See — the FROM fund lost units, the TO fund gained units. But <span class="hl">Total Investment did not change!</span> Not one rupee was added or removed. Money just moved from one fund to another inside the portfolio.</p>

    <p class="subsection">4 TRANSACTION TYPES — SUMMARY</p>

    <p class="action">[Show TransactionHistory sheet]</p>
    <p>All 4 types are recorded in Transaction History with date, fund, units, price, amount:</p>
    <p><span class="hl">Buy (SIP):</span> Total Investment <span style="color:#4f8;">INCREASES ↑</span> — regular monthly investment</p>
    <p><span class="hl">Buy (Lumpsum):</span> Total Investment <span style="color:#4f8;">INCREASES ↑</span> — one-time extra investment</p>
    <p><span class="hl">Sell/Redeem:</span> Total Investment <span style="color:#f66;">DECREASES ↓</span> — taking money out</p>
    <p><span class="hl">Switch:</span> Total Investment <span style="color:#ffd369;">STAYS SAME →</span> — moving money between funds</p>

    <p><span class="hl">When to use Sell vs Switch?</span> If you sell one fund to buy another inside the <span class="hl">same portfolio</span> — use Switch. If you sell to take money out, or to buy in a <span class="hl">different portfolio</span> — use Sell in one and Buy in the other.</p>

    <p class="subsection">BEST PRACTICES</p>
    <p>1. Record your SIP <span class="hl">on the same day it gets processed</span> — check your AMC statement for exact units and NAV.</p>
    <p>2. Always use <span class="hl">Switch</span> when moving between funds in the same portfolio — never do a Sell + Buy. Switch keeps your total investment correct.</p>
    <p>3. Before selling, always check the <span class="hl">Transaction Preview</span> — it shows your exact profit or loss before you confirm.</p>
    <p>4. If the market crashes and a fund is below ATH — that is a good time for <span class="hl">Lumpsum Buy</span>, not panic selling.</p>
    <p>5. Record transactions regularly — don't let 6 months pile up. Do it monthly after each SIP.</p>

    <p>When you sell or switch, did you actually make a profit? Capital Friends tracks <span class="hl">Realized P&L</span> (actual profit from withdrawals) and <span class="hl">Unrealized P&L</span> (paper profit on holdings) separately. Check the AllPortfolios sheet — columns J through O show the complete breakdown.
