  <div class="yt-desc">If you're doing SIP, your average purchase price keeps changing — so you LOSE TRACK of how discounted a fund actually is during crashes. A fund could be 25% below its all-time high (huge buying opportunity!), but you think "it's only down a little from my average."

Capital Friends tracks the All-Time High (ATH) NAV of every mutual fund and shows you exactly how far below ATH each fund is — with color-coded alerts. This helps you decide: should I increase SIP? Use ladder investments? Or invest lumpsum?

No more flying blind during market corrections!

    <p style="color:#888;font-size:12px;"><i>In previous videos we created portfolios, recorded transactions, and learned the difference between realized and unrealized P&L. Now let's use ATH tracking to find buying opportunities.</i></p>

    <p>Hi everyone. When the market falls 10-20%, news channels scream "CRASH!" and most people panic and stop their SIPs. But smart investors do the opposite — they look for buying opportunities. The question is: <span class="hl">which funds have fallen the most?</span></p>

    <p class="subsection">WHAT WE'LL COVER</p>
    <p>1. What is All-Time High (ATH) and why it matters</p>
    <p>2. The SIP investor's blind spot — why your average price misleads you</p>

    <p>Capital Friends answers this automatically. Let me show you.</p>

    <p class="subsection">LIVE DEMO</p>

    <p class="subsection">WHAT IS ALL-TIME HIGH (ATH)?</p>

    <p>Every mutual fund has a highest NAV it has ever reached. That is its All-Time High. For example, if a fund's peak NAV was ₹100 and current NAV is ₹93.80, it is about 6% below its ATH.</p>
    <p class="action">[Explain: % Below ATH = how much the current NAV has fallen from its highest ever point]</p>

    <p>A fund that is 6% below ATH has had a small correction. A fund that is 25% below ATH has had a major crash. <span class="hl">That 25% dip could be a buying opportunity</span> — the same fund at a much lower price.</p>

    <p class="subsection">THE SIP INVESTOR'S BLIND SPOT</p>

    <p>Here is something most SIP investors don't realize. Let's say you have been doing SIP in a fund for two years. You bought at ₹80, ₹85, ₹90, ₹95. The NAV reached ₹100 — that is its ATH. Then market crashes and NAV falls to ₹75.</p>

    <p><span class="hl">How far has the fund actually fallen?</span> It is 25% below its ATH. That is a HUGE crash. Great buying opportunity!</p>

    <p>But when you look at your portfolio, what do you see? Your average purchase price is ₹87. Current NAV is ₹75. You think "okay it is down a bit, but not that much." <span class="warn">You completely miss the fact that the fund is 25% below its peak!</span></p>

    <p>This is the SIP investor's blind spot. <span class="hl">Your average price keeps changing with every SIP installment. So you lose track of how discounted the fund actually is from its all-time high.</span></p>

    <p>ATH tracking solves this. It shows you the fund's TRUE market position — independent of when YOU bought. A fund 20% below ATH is a 20% discount, period. Doesn't matter what your average price is.</p>

    <p>This is critical for making smart decisions:</p>
    <p>• Should I increase my SIP amount? (5-10% below ATH)</p>
    <p>• Should I use ladder investments — buying in steps as it falls further? (10-15% below ATH)</p>
    <p>• Should I invest a lumpsum right now? (20%+ below ATH)</p>

    <p>Without ATH tracking, you are flying blind. With it, you know exactly when to buy more.</p>

    <p class="subsection">WHY ATH MATTERS</p>

    <p>Markets always recover. In the history of Indian markets, every crash has been followed by a recovery to new highs. So when a quality fund is 20% below its ATH:</p>
    <p>1. You are buying at a <span class="hl">discount</span> compared to its proven ability</p>
    <p>2. When it recovers (and quality funds always do), your returns will be higher</p>
    <p>3. This is the best time to add extra lumpsum — buy more when others are scared</p>

    <p>But you need data to know which funds are down and by how much. That is exactly what Capital Friends gives you.</p>

    <p class="subsection">PORTFOLIO COLUMNS — ATH NAV & % BELOW ATH</p>

    <p class="action">[Show PFL-Retirement sheet — columns R and S]</p>
    <p>Every portfolio sheet has two columns at the end:</p>
    <p><span class="fn">Column R: ATH NAV</span> — the all-time highest NAV this fund has ever reached</p>
    <p><span class="fn">Column S: % Below ATH</span> — how far below ATH the current NAV is</p>

    <p class="action">[Point to each fund's ATH NAV and % Below ATH columns — explain what the numbers mean for your specific funds]</p>

    <p>These numbers update automatically. When the fund makes a new ATH, % Below ATH becomes 0%. When it falls, the percentage increases.</p>

    <p class="subsection">COLOR-CODED ALERTS</p>

    <p>In the email report, ATH information is shown below each fund's NAV with color coding that gets more intense as the drop gets bigger:</p>

    <p>• <span style="color:#b8860b;">1-5% below ATH: goldenrod</span> — small dip, normal market movement</p>
    <p>• <span style="color:#e67e00;">5-10% below ATH: orange</span> — worth watching, consider extra SIP</p>
    <p>• <span style="color:#d84315;font-weight:bold;">10-20% below ATH: deep orange bold</span> — significant correction, good buying opportunity</p>
    <p>• <span style="color:#c62828;font-weight:bold;">20%+ below ATH: red bold</span> — major dip, seriously consider adding lumpsum</p>

    <p>When you see red in your email — that is the market telling you "sale is on!" Like Flipkart Big Billion Day but for mutual funds.</p>

    <p class="subsection">MF_ATH_DATA SHEET</p>

    <p class="action">[Show MF_ATH_Data sheet tab]</p>
    <p>Capital Friends maintains a database of ATH NAV for ALL mutual funds in India — not just the ones you own. This sheet imports ATH data from our master database. Columns: Scheme Code, Fund Name, ATH NAV, ATH Date, Last Checked, Current NAV, % Below ATH.</p>

    <p>Your portfolio sheets use VLOOKUP to pull ATH data for your specific funds from this database.</p>

    <p class="subsection">EMAIL REPORT — ATH PER FUND</p>

    <p class="action">[Show sample email report — ATH section under each fund]</p>
    <p>In the daily email, below each fund's NAV line (Current/Avg), you see the ATH info. For example:</p>
    <p>"NAV: ₹93.80 (Avg: ₹81.25)"</p>
    <p style="color:#e67e00;">"6.2% below ATH (₹100.00 on 15-Jan-2026)"</p>

    <p>Every morning without opening any app, you know which of your funds are in a dip. If you see a fund 15% below ATH — that is your signal to open the Buy Lumpsum form and invest extra.</p>

    <p class="subsection">HOW TO USE ATH FOR BUYING DECISIONS</p>

    <p>Here is a simple strategy:</p>
    <p>1. <span class="hl">0-5% below ATH:</span> Continue normal SIP. No action needed.</p>
    <p>2. <span class="hl">5-10% below ATH:</span> Consider increasing SIP amount for that fund.</p>
    <p>3. <span class="hl">10-20% below ATH:</span> Good time to add lumpsum. Use the Buy Lumpsum feature.</p>
    <p>4. <span class="hl">20%+ below ATH:</span> Strong buying opportunity. Invest significant lumpsum if you have cash available.</p>

    <p>Capital Friends combined with the rebalancing feature gives you the complete picture — ATH tells you WHERE the opportunity is, rebalancing tells you HOW MUCH to invest.</p>

    <p class="subsection">WHEN NOT TO BLINDLY BUY THE DIP</p>

    <p class="warn">Important: ATH is not investment advice. A fund falling 30% could mean:</p>
    <p>1. Temporary market correction → great buying opportunity</p>
    <p>2. Fundamental problem with the fund → avoid buying more</p>

    <p>Always check WHY the fund fell. If the entire market is down, it is usually temporary. If only your specific fund is down while the market is up, something may be wrong with that fund. Use ATH as a <span class="hl">signal</span>, not a <span class="hl">blind strategy</span>.</p>

    <p>ATH tracking is automatic — you don't need to do anything. Just check your portfolio columns R and S, or wait for the daily email report. Capital Friends does the work for you.
