    <p class="action">[TITLE CARD: Automated Email Reports, Reminders & Dashboard | FREE Portfolio Tracker Web App]</p>

    <p style="color:#888;font-size:12px;"><i>In previous videos we set up everything — mutual funds, stocks, other investments, insurance, loans, financial goals, and portfolio mapping. Now let's automate it all.</i></p>

    <p>Hi everyone. Last video of this series! We will cover three big features — reminders, email reports, and the dashboard.</p>

    <p class="subsection">WHAT WE'LL COVER</p>
    <p>1. Reminders — never miss insurance renewal or EMI</p>
    <p>2. Email Reports — automated family wealth report</p>
    <p>3. Dashboard — complete financial picture in one view</p>
    <p>4. Series recap — all 13 videos covered</p>
    <p>Let me start with reminders.</p>

    <p class="subsection">LIVE DEMO</p>

    <p class="subsection">REMINDERS</p>

    <p>How many times have you missed an insurance renewal? Or forgot a tax filing deadline? Capital Friends sends you email alerts before any due date.</p>

    <p class="action">[In the sidebar, click Reminders → Add Reminder]</p>

    <p><span class="hl">Insurance Renewal:</span></p>
    <p>Select type Insurance Renewal — it auto-suggests a title and 60 days advance notice. Enter your policy name, due date, set frequency to Yearly, priority High. Click Add.</p>

    <p><span class="hl">Monthly EMI:</span></p>
    <p class="action">[Add EMI reminder — Monthly frequency, set the date and advance notice days]</p>

    <p><span class="hl">Tax Filing:</span></p>
    <p class="action">[Add Tax Filing reminder — Yearly, set due date and advance notice]</p>

    <p>12 types available: Insurance, EMI, Tax Filing, SIP, Investment Review, Document Renewal, Fixed Deposit Maturity, and more.</p>

    <p><span class="hl">Setup Daily Check:</span></p>
    <p class="action">[In the sidebar, click Reminders → Setup Daily Check]</p>
    <p>This creates a trigger that runs at 8 AM every day. If any reminder is due within the advance notice period, you get an email. One click setup. Done!</p>

    <p><span class="hl">Test Reminder Email:</span></p>
    <p class="action">[In the sidebar, click Reminders → Test Reminder Email]</p>
    <p>Sends a test email right now to check if reminders are working.</p>

    <p><span class="hl">Edit Reminder:</span> <span class="fn">Reminders → Edit Reminder</span> — change due date, frequency, or delete.</p>
    <p><span class="hl">View All:</span> <span class="fn">Reminders → View All Reminders</span> — all reminders in one sheet.</p>

    <p class="subsection">FAMILY WEALTH EMAIL REPORT</p>

    <p>This is the feature that makes Capital Friends truly special. Imagine every morning, your entire family gets a complete wealth report by email. Without opening the app.</p>

    <p><span class="hl">Email Settings:</span></p>
    <p class="action">[Go to the Settings page in the app → Email Settings]</p>
    <p><span class="fn">Enable Email Reports:</span> Yes</p>
    <p><span class="fn">Frequency:</span> Daily (or Weekly/Monthly)</p>
    <p><span class="fn">Time:</span> 9 AM</p>
    <p>Click Save. Every day at 9 AM, report is sent automatically. No manual work needed.</p>

    <p><span class="hl">Who receives?</span> All family members with "Include in Email Reports" = Yes. When you add family members in <span class="fn">Family Members → Add Member</span>, you check this box. Anyone who has it checked gets the email.</p>

    <p><span class="hl">Send Now:</span></p>
    <p class="action">[Click Send Email Report → Yes]</p>
    <p class="action">[Show email in inbox]</p>

    <p>Look at this email! Everything is here:</p>
    <p><span class="fn">Summary:</span> Total Net Worth, Total Assets, Total Liabilities</p>
    <p><span class="fn">Mutual Funds:</span> Each fund with NAV (Current/Avg), current value, P&L.</p>

    <p>And below each fund — <span class="hl">ATH info</span> showing how far below the all-time high:</p>
    <p>• <span style="color:#b8860b;">1-5% below ATH: goldenrod</span> — small dip, normal</p>
    <p>• <span style="color:#e67e00;">5-10% below: orange</span> — worth watching</p>
    <p>• <span style="color:#d84315;font-weight:bold;">10-20% below: deep orange bold</span> — significant correction</p>
    <p>• <span style="color:#c62828;font-weight:bold;">20%+ below: red bold</span> — major dip, possible buying opportunity</p>

    <p>The email also shows <span class="hl">Unrealized P&L</span> (blue — paper profit on holdings you still own) and <span class="hl">Realized P&L</span> (green — actual profit from withdrawals) separately. Your family sees the true picture.</p>

    <p><span class="fn">Stocks:</span> Live prices, P&L for each stock</p>
    <p><span class="fn">Other Investments:</span> Gold, PPF, Real Estate values</p>
    <p><span class="fn">Insurance:</span> All policies with sum assured and nominee</p>
    <p><span class="fn">Goals:</span> Progress for each financial goal</p>
    <p><span class="fn">Action Items:</span> From health check — what you need to fix (like "Create a Will")</p>

    <p>Your family gets this every day. If something happens to you, they have everything — where the money is, how much, who is the nominee, which insurance to claim. That is the real purpose of Capital Friends.</p>

    <p class="subsection">DASHBOARD</p>

    <p class="action">[In the sidebar, click Dashboard]</p>
    <p>Same information as the email — but viewable anytime inside the app.</p>

    <p><span class="fn">Top:</span> Total Net Worth, Total Assets, Total Liabilities, Net P&L.</p>
    <p><span class="fn">Asset Allocation:</span> Equity, debt, gold, real estate — how your money is divided.</p>
    <p><span class="fn">Market Cap:</span> Large cap, mid cap, small cap split — based on Fund Composition data you enter via <span class="fn">Mutual Funds → Fund Composition Breakdown</span>.</p>
    <p><span class="fn">Portfolio Details:</span> Each portfolio with funds, P&L, rebalancing suggestions.</p>

    <p>Takes 10-30 seconds to generate because it reads all your sheets. But the result is a complete financial picture.</p>

    <p><span class="hl">About:</span> <span class="fn">Settings → About</span> — version info and credits.</p>
    <p><span class="hl">Support Developer:</span> <span class="fn">Settings → Support Developer</span> — Capital Friends is completely free.</p>

    <p class="subsection">SERIES RECAP — ALL 13 VIDEOS</p>
