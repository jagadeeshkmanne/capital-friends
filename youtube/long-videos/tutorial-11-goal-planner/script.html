  <div class="yt-desc">Investing ₹1,000 without a goal? You might make 100% return (₹1,000 profit) — but that's meaningless money. Invest ₹15,000/month for a ₹50L house goal? Even 10% return on ₹1L = ₹10,000 REAL profit moving you toward your house.

This is why goal-based investing works. Capital Friends calculates exact monthly SIP for retirement, education, emergency fund, house, car — any goal. Inflation-aware with smart defaults per goal type. Optional lumpsum + SIP combined mode.

    <p class="action">[TITLE CARD: FREE SIP Calculator & Goal Planner (Retirement, Education, House) | Portfolio Tracker Web App]</p>

    <p style="color:#888;font-size:12px;"><i>In previous videos we set up tracking for mutual funds, stocks, gold, PPF, insurance, and loans — your complete financial picture. Now let's plan our goals.</i></p>

    <p>Hi everyone. Without a goal, you are investing blindly. You don't know if your SIP is enough. Should I invest ₹5,000 per month or ₹50,000? It depends on your goals.</p>

    <p>Many people invest without a goal. They put ₹1,000 just to test the market. They get 100% return and celebrate — "I made ₹1,000 profit!" But that amount is meaningless. You cannot do anything with ₹1,000.</p>

    <p>When you have a clear goal — say ₹50 lakhs for a house in 10 years — Capital Friends tells you exactly how much to invest. Maybe ₹15,000 per month. Now when your ₹1 lakh portfolio grows by 10%, that's ₹10,000 profit. Real money. Meaningful progress toward your house. <span class="hl">This is why goal-based investing works. You invest the right amount for a specific purpose.</span> Not random small amounts hoping to get lucky.</p>

    <p class="subsection">WHAT WE'LL COVER</p>
    <p>1. Goal Planner Wizard — plan all goals at once</p>
    <p>2. Emergency Fund, Retirement, Education goals</p>
    <p>3. Lumpsum + SIP combined mode — reduce your SIP</p>
    <p>4. Investment Summary — total monthly SIP needed</p>
    <p>5. Create all goals & Goals sheet explained</p>
    <p>Capital Friends calculates exactly how much you need. Let me show you.</p>

    <p class="subsection">LIVE DEMO</p>

    <p class="action">[In the sidebar, click Goals → Goal Planner (Wizard)]</p>
    <p>Goal types: Emergency Fund, Retirement, House, Education, Marriage, Car, Vacation, Custom.</p>
    <p>Enter your <span class="fn">Age</span> and <span class="fn">Monthly Expenses</span>.</p>

    <p>One smart feature: Capital Friends uses <span class="hl">inflation-aware calculations</span> with different default inflation rates per goal type. Education inflation is 10%, House is 8%, Retirement is 6%, Car is 5%, and Emergency Fund is 0%. These defaults are based on real Indian data — you can always adjust them.</p>

    <p><span class="hl">Emergency Fund:</span></p>
    <p>Auto-calculates 6 months of expenses as target. Set target year, expected return (8%), and inflation (0% for emergencies — you need a fixed amount). It calculates SIP needed instantly.</p>

    <p><span class="hl">Retirement:</span></p>
    <p>Enter your retirement age. It uses the 25x annual expenses rule with 6% inflation to calculate the target corpus. Enter expected return (12% for equity). The SIP might seem high — but that is the power of compounding over many years.</p>

    <p><span class="hl">Child's Education:</span></p>
    <p>Enter child's current age, when you need the money, today's cost. With 10% education inflation (the default for education goals), the future cost is calculated automatically. SIP needed to reach that target is shown.</p>

    <p><span class="hl">Lumpsum + SIP Mode:</span></p>
    <p>This is optional but very smart. If you can invest a lumpsum right now, the SIP drops significantly. Because that lumpsum will grow over the years through compounding, so you need less from SIP.</p>
    <p>Just enter the lumpsum amount in the optional field. If left empty, it shows only SIP + reference lumpsum. If filled, it recalculates: remaining SIP = what is needed after lumpsum grows.</p>

    <p>Bottom shows <span class="fn">Investment Summary</span> — total monthly SIP across all goals. This is your total monthly investment target.</p>

    <p>Click <span class="fn">Create All Goals</span>.</p>

    <p class="action">[Show Goals view in the app]</p>
    <p>All goals created! Columns G, H, I, J, K, N are <span class="hl">live formulas</span>. When you map your portfolios to these goals using <span class="fn">Goals → Map Portfolios to Goal</span>, the "Current Allocated" column updates automatically based on real portfolio values. No manual tracking needed.</p>

    <p><span class="hl">Add Goal individually:</span> <span class="fn">Goals → Add Goal</span> — for adding one goal at a time.</p>
    <p><span class="hl">Edit Goal:</span> <span class="fn">Goals → Edit Goal</span> — change target, year, or inflation rate later.</p>

    <p class="subsection">BEST PRACTICES</p>
    <p>1. Use <span class="hl">realistic return rates</span> — 10-12% for equity, 7-8% for debt. Don't assume 15-20%.</p>
    <p>2. Use <span class="hl">realistic inflation</span> — Capital Friends sets smart defaults (Education: 10%, House: 8%, Retirement: 6%, Car: 5%, Emergency: 0%) but you can always adjust. Underestimating inflation is the biggest mistake.</p>
    <p>3. Start with your <span class="hl">top 3 goals</span> — Emergency Fund, Retirement, and one more. Don't overwhelm yourself with 8 goals on day one.</p>
    <p>4. Emergency fund should be your <span class="hl">first goal</span> — before retirement, before education. Without this safety net, any crisis forces you to break investments.</p>
    <p>5. If total SIP seems too high — use the <span class="hl">Lumpsum + SIP mode</span> to reduce monthly burden. Even a small lumpsum today makes a big difference over 10+ years.</p>
    <p>6. <span class="hl">Review goals yearly</span> — expenses change, income changes. Use Edit Goal to update targets.</p>

    <p>Now you know exactly how much SIP you need for every goal. Capital Friends does the math — with inflation-aware calculations tailored to each goal type — you just invest.
