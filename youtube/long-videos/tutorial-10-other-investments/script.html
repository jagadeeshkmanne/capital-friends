    <p class="action">[TITLE CARD: Track Gold, PPF, Insurance & Loans in One Place | FREE Investment Tracker Web App]</p>

    <p style="color:#888;font-size:12px;"><i>In previous videos we set up mutual fund portfolios with rebalancing, P&L, and ATH tracking, plus stock portfolios with live prices. Now let's track everything else.</i></p>

    <p>Hi everyone. Your wealth is more than mutual funds and stocks. You have gold, PPF, real estate, FDs. You have insurance policies your family must know about. You have loans that reduce your net worth.</p>

    <p class="subsection">WHAT WE'LL COVER</p>
    <p>1. Other investments — Gold, PPF, Real Estate, FD</p>
    <p>2. Link real estate to loan</p>
    <p>3. Insurance policies — Health, Term Life, Motor</p>
    <p>4. Liabilities — Home Loan, Car Loan</p>
    <p>5. Real Net Worth = Assets minus Liabilities</p>
    <p>Capital Friends tracks all of them. Let me show you.</p>

    <p class="subsection">LIVE DEMO</p>

    <p class="subsection">OTHER INVESTMENTS</p>

    <p class="action">[In the sidebar, click Other Investments → Add Investment]</p>

    <p><span class="hl">Gold:</span></p>
    <p>Select type Gold. Enter a name, select the family member, and fill in invested amount and current value. You can add custom fields like quantity and storage location. Click Add.</p>

    <p><span class="hl">PPF:</span></p>
    <p class="action">[Add PPF — select member, enter invested and current value]</p>

    <p><span class="hl">Real Estate with Loan Link:</span></p>
    <p class="action">[Add Real Estate — enter property details, invested and current value]</p>
    <p>See this option — <span class="fn">Link to Loan</span>. Select "Quick add new loan" — enter loan type, lender, outstanding balance. Now property and loan are connected. In the dashboard, it shows: Asset value minus Loan = Net equity.</p>

    <p><span class="hl">Fixed Deposit:</span></p>
    <p class="action">[Add FD — select member, enter invested and current value]</p>

    <p><span class="hl">Edit / View All:</span></p>
    <p class="action">[In the sidebar, click Other Investments → Edit Investment]</p>
    <p>Update current values whenever you want. Gold price went up? Select Gold investment, update current value, save. Takes 10 seconds.</p>

    <p class="action">[In the sidebar, click Other Investments → View All]</p>
    <p>All investments in one sheet. Total invested, total current value, P&L.</p>

    <p class="subsection">INSURANCE POLICIES</p>

    <p>Insurance is the most important thing your family should know. If something happens to you, they need policy numbers and how to claim. Most families don't know this information.</p>

    <p class="action">[In the sidebar, click Insurance → Add Insurance Policy]</p>

    <p><span class="hl">Health Insurance:</span></p>
    <p>Select type Health Insurance. Fill in the details:</p>
    <p><span class="fn">Company</span>, <span class="fn">Policy Number</span>, <span class="fn">Policy Name</span>, <span class="fn">Insured Member</span>, <span class="fn">Nominee</span>, <span class="fn">Sum Assured</span></p>
    <p>Add premium amount, expiry date. Click Add.</p>

    <p>See — it also <span class="hl">updated the Financial Health Check</span> automatically! It knows I have health insurance now.</p>

    <p><span class="hl">Term Life Insurance:</span></p>
    <p class="action">[Add Term Life — enter company, sum assured, premium]</p>

    <p><span class="hl">Motor Insurance:</span></p>
    <p class="action">[Add Motor — enter company, vehicle details, IDV amount]</p>

    <p><span class="hl">Edit / View All:</span></p>
    <p><span class="fn">Insurance → Edit Insurance Policy</span> — update premium, renew, change nominee.</p>
    <p><span class="fn">Insurance → View All Policies</span> — all policies in one sheet. Your family opens this and sees everything.</p>

    <p class="subsection">LIABILITIES (LOANS)</p>

    <p>Many people only count assets — "I have X lakhs in investments!" But if you have loans, your real net worth is assets minus loans. Capital Friends shows the true picture.</p>

    <p>We already added a Home Loan when we linked it to the property. Let me add another loan.</p>

    <p class="action">[In the sidebar, click Liabilities → Add Liability]</p>
    <p>Select type (Home Loan, Auto Loan, Personal Loan, etc.). Enter lender, member, outstanding balance, EMI, interest rate, tenure. Click Add.</p>

    <p class="action">[In the sidebar, click Liabilities → View All]</p>
    <p>All loans in one place with total liabilities.</p>

    <p>In dashboard and email: Total Assets minus Total Liabilities = <span class="hl">Real Net Worth</span>. That is the number that matters.</p>

    <p>When you pay off a loan — <span class="fn">Edit Liability</span>, change status to "Closed". Balance becomes zero. Your net worth goes up!</p>

    <p class="subsection">BEST PRACTICES</p>
    <p>1. Update <span class="hl">current values quarterly</span> — gold price changes, FD matures, real estate appreciates. Keep numbers current.</p>
    <p>2. Add <span class="hl">all insurance policies</span> — health, term, motor, home. Your family needs this information if something happens to you.</p>
    <p>3. Always add <span class="hl">nominee details</span> to insurance — this is the most critical information for claims.</p>
    <p>4. Link real estate to its loan — the dashboard then shows the <span class="hl">net equity</span>, not just the property value.</p>
    <p>5. Update loan <span class="hl">outstanding balance yearly</span> — as you pay EMIs, the balance reduces and your net worth increases.</p>
    <p>6. Focus on <span class="hl">net worth, not just assets</span> — ₹50 lakh in investments with ₹36 lakh in loans means only ₹14 lakh real net worth.</p>
