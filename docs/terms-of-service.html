        <p>
            Capital Friends is a free, open-source financial tracking tool built with Google Apps Script.
            The app creates a Google Sheet template copy <strong>directly in YOUR Google Drive</strong> using your permissions.
            You are the owner from the moment it's created. The spreadsheet helps you track family
            wealth, manage portfolio allocation, and receive financial security alerts.
        </p>

        <h2>3. User Eligibility</h2>
