        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="last-updated"><strong>Last Updated:</strong> January 2025</p>
        <p class="last-updated"><strong>Effective Date:</strong> January 2025</p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p><strong>In Plain English:</strong> Capital Friends is a free Google Sheets template you copy to your own Google Drive. After you answer a short questionnaire, the template becomes 100% yours - we transfer complete ownership to you. We only collect your email address and questionnaire answers for statistical purposes. We NEVER have access to your financial data, family information, or any sensitive details you enter into your copy.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome to <strong>Capital Friends by Jagadeesh Manne</strong> ("we," "our," or "us"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our Google Sheets-based family wealth tracking template.</p>

        <p><strong>Capital Friends</strong> is an open-source project hosted on GitHub that provides a Google Sheets template for personal family finance management. Unlike traditional web applications, Capital Friends operates entirely within your Google Drive after initial setup.</p>

        <h3>How Capital Friends Works</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>You Request a Copy:</strong> You visit our web app and request a personalized copy of the Capital Friends template</li>
            <li><strong>We Create Your Copy:</strong> Our system creates a copy of the master template in our Google Drive</li>
            <li><strong>You Answer Questions:</strong> A brief 8-question questionnaire helps us understand your needs (answers are optional)</li>
            <li><strong>Ownership Transfers to You:</strong> Immediately after you submit the questionnaire, the Google Sheet is transferred to your ownership using Google's <code>setOwner()</code> function</li>
            <li><strong>You Own Everything:</strong> From that moment forward, the sheet is 100% yours. It lives in your Google Drive, and we have ZERO access to it</li>
        </ol>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p><strong>Key Privacy Principle:</strong> After ownership transfer, we cannot access your sheet even if we wanted to. Google's permission system ensures that once ownership is transferred, the original creator (us) loses all access unless you explicitly grant it back.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We collect minimal information, and ONLY during the initial template copy and questionnaire process. Here's exactly what we collect:</p>

        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Data Type</th>
                    <th>What We Collect</th>
                    <th>Why We Collect It</th>
                    <th>Where It's Stored</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Email Address</strong></td>
                    <td>Your Google account email (e.g., you@gmail.com)</td>
                    <td>To transfer ownership of the template to you using Google's setOwner() API</td>
                    <td>Not stored - only used during ownership transfer</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Questionnaire Answers</strong></td>
                    <td>8 Yes/No answers about your financial security practices</td>
                    <td>To customize security recommendations and email reminders in YOUR copy only</td>
                    <td>Stored only in YOUR copy after ownership transfer</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <h3>The 8 Questionnaire Questions</h3>
        <p>These are the exact questions we ask, and your answers are stored as simple Yes/No values:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Do you have a single place where you track all your family's bank accounts and investments?</li>
            <li>Do you regularly review your family's complete net worth (at least quarterly)?</li>
            <li>Do you have a written plan for asset distribution if something happens to you?</li>
            <li>Does at least one other trusted family member know where all your important documents are located?</li>
            <li>Do you have a list of all your family members' important IDs (PAN, Aadhar, etc.) in one place?</li>
            <li>Do you regularly backup your critical financial documents?</li>
            <li>Do you have clear instructions for your family on accessing accounts in case of emergency?</li>
            <li>Do you track your investment portfolio's actual allocation vs. your target allocation?</li>
        </ol>

        <p><strong>Important:</strong> These answers are used to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Customize the security reminder emails that YOUR sheet will send to YOU (via YOUR Gmail account, not ours)</li>
            <li>Generate recommendations in your "Security Questionnaire Results" tab</li>
            <li>Provide us with aggregate statistics (e.g., "73% of users don't have a backup plan")</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Information We DO NOT Collect</h2>
        <p>This is just as important as what we DO collect. Here's what we NEVER have access to:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Your Financial Data:</strong> Bank balances, account numbers, investment values, transaction history, net worth calculations</li>
            <li><strong>Family Member Information:</strong> Names, dates of birth, PAN numbers, Aadhar numbers, passport details, phone numbers, addresses</li>
            <li><strong>Bank Account Details:</strong> Account numbers, IFSC codes, branch names, account types, balances</li>
            <li><strong>Investment Details:</strong> Stock holdings, mutual fund investments, FD details, gold holdings, real estate values</li>
            <li><strong>Document Information:</strong> Locations of wills, deeds, insurance policies, or any documents you track</li>
            <li><strong>Email Content:</strong> The security reminder emails are sent FROM your Gmail account TO your email address. We never see the content or have access to your Gmail</li>
            <li><strong>Usage Patterns:</strong> How often you use the sheet, what features you use, what calculations you perform</li>
            <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> Your device type, browser, IP address, location</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p><strong>Why We Don't Have Access:</strong> After the ownership transfer, Google's permission system treats you as the sole owner. The Apps Script code bound to your sheet runs under YOUR Google account permissions, not ours. Even if we kept the Sheet ID, attempting to access your sheet would result in a "Permission Denied" error.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>4. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>The limited information we collect is used for:</p>

        <h3>4.1 Ownership Transfer (Required)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Your email address is used to execute the <code>file.setOwner(userEmail)</code> function</li>
            <li>This is a Google API requirement - we need your email to transfer ownership</li>
            <li>This happens automatically after you complete the questionnaire</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4.2 Usage Statistics (Anonymous)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Count how many people have used Capital Friends</li>
            <li>Track which versions are in use</li>
            <li>Understand questionnaire response patterns to improve recommendations</li>
            <li>Example: "1,247 users have copied the template; 68% said they don't track net worth regularly"</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4.3 Technical Support (Rare)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>If you contact us with a technical issue, we may use your email to respond</li>
            <li>We may look up your copy's creation date/version to help troubleshoot</li>
            <li>We CANNOT access your actual sheet data even for support</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4.4 Feature Customization (In Your Copy)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Your questionnaire answers are stored IN YOUR COPY (not just our tracking sheet)</li>
            <li>The Apps Script in your copy uses these answers to customize email reminders</li>
            <li>Example: If you answered "No" to Question 3 (asset distribution plan), your copy will remind you about this</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Data Storage & Security</h2>

        <h3>5.1 No Central Database</h3>
        <p>Capital Friends does NOT maintain a central tracking database. After ownership transfer:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your email is NOT stored by us</li>
            <li>Your questionnaire answers are only in YOUR copy</li>
            <li>We have no record of your financial data or usage patterns</li>
            <li>Complete privacy - your data never leaves your Google Drive</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5.2 Your Copy (Your Google Drive)</h3>
        <p>After ownership transfer, your copy is stored in YOUR Google Drive with:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Google's enterprise-grade security</li>
            <li>Your own Google account's privacy settings</li>
            <li>Your choice of sharing permissions (we recommend keeping it private)</li>
            <li>Your own backup and retention policies</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5.3 Data Sources</h3>
        <p>Capital Friends uses Google Sheets' IMPORTRANGE function to fetch public reference data:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Master MF Database:</strong> Imports mutual fund names, codes, categories, and NAV prices from a public master database (updated daily by the developer)</li>
            <li><strong>Stock Master Database:</strong> Imports stock symbols, company names, and ISIN codes from a public reference sheet</li>
            <li><strong>Read-only access:</strong> Data flows FROM master database TO your sheet only - your financial data never goes back</li>
            <li><strong>No server-side API calls:</strong> The master database (maintained by the developer) fetches NAV data from AMFI India, but YOUR copy only uses IMPORTRANGE</li>
            <li><strong>No user data sent:</strong> IMPORTRANGE only reads public reference data - your personal financial data never leaves your Drive</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5A. Data Protection Mechanisms & Security Safeguards</h2>
        <p>Capital Friends implements multiple layers of security to protect sensitive user data. This section details the technical and organizational measures we employ.</p>

        <h3>5A.1 Encryption & Data Protection</h3>

        <h4>Encryption at Rest</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Google Drive Encryption:</strong> All user data (financial information, family details, PAN/Aadhar numbers) is stored in Google Drive, which uses AES-256 encryption at rest</li>
            <li><strong>Server-Side Encryption:</strong> Google automatically encrypts all files before writing them to disk across multiple data centers</li>
            <li><strong>No Local Storage:</strong> Capital Friends does not store sensitive data in browser localStorage, sessionStorage, or cookies - all data resides encrypted in Google's infrastructure</li>
            <li><strong>Apps Script Properties:</strong> Document-specific properties (used for tracking first-time setup) are encrypted by Google Apps Script platform</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Encryption in Transit</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>TLS 1.2+:</strong> All communications between your browser and Google's servers use TLS (Transport Layer Security) version 1.2 or higher</li>
            <li><strong>HTTPS Only:</strong> The web app, landing page, and all API calls are served exclusively over HTTPS (HTTP Strict Transport Security enabled)</li>
            <li><strong>Encrypted Email Transmission:</strong> Emails sent via Gmail use TLS for delivery (encrypted in transit between mail servers)</li>
            <li><strong>No Plaintext Transmission:</strong> Sensitive data is never transmitted in plaintext over the network</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5A.2 Access Controls & Authentication</h3>

        <h4>User Authentication</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Google OAuth 2.0:</strong> All access to your data requires Google account authentication - no separate passwords or credentials</li>
            <li><strong>Session Management:</strong> Google Apps Script manages secure sessions with automatic timeout after inactivity</li>
            <li><strong>Multi-Factor Authentication Support:</strong> Capital Friends respects your Google account's 2FA settings (we recommend enabling 2FA)</li>
            <li><strong>No Password Storage:</strong> Capital Friends never stores, transmits, or has access to your Google account password</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Ownership-Based Access Control</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Immediate Ownership Transfer:</strong> The <code>file.setOwner(userEmail)</code> API transfers full ownership to you, removing developer access</li>
            <li><strong>Permission Revocation:</strong> After transfer, the original creator (developer) has ZERO access - enforced by Google Drive's permission model</li>
            <li><strong>Granular Sharing Controls:</strong> You control who can view/edit your copy via Google Drive's sharing settings</li>
            <li><strong>Private by Default:</strong> Newly created copies are private to your account only (not shared publicly)</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>OAuth Scope Restrictions</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Minimal Scopes:</strong> Capital Friends requests only 3 OAuth scopes (gmail.send, script.scriptapp, script.container.ui)</li>
            <li><strong>No Broad Permissions:</strong> Does NOT request access to all Google Drive files, Gmail inbox, Calendar, or Contacts</li>
            <li><strong>No Drive Access:</strong> Does not request <code>drive.file</code> or other Drive scopes - the spreadsheet already exists in your Drive after ownership transfer</li>
            <li><strong>User-Revocable:</strong> You can revoke permissions anytime via Google Account Settings → Security → Third-party apps</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5A.3 Data Minimization & Retention</h3>

        <h4>Minimal Data Collection</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Email Only:</strong> We collect only your email address for ownership transfer (not stored permanently)</li>
            <li><strong>No Financial Data Collection:</strong> We never access, collect, or store your bank balances, investment values, or transaction history</li>
            <li><strong>No PII Harvesting:</strong> We don't collect PAN numbers, Aadhar numbers, phone numbers, addresses, or other personally identifiable information</li>
            <li><strong>Optional Questionnaire:</strong> The 8-question security assessment is stored only in YOUR copy, not our systems</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Data Retention Policies</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>No Long-Term Storage:</strong> Email addresses are used only during the ownership transfer process and are not retained in our systems</li>
            <li><strong>User-Controlled Retention:</strong> All financial data in your copy is retained according to YOUR deletion schedule</li>
            <li><strong>Automatic Cleanup:</strong> No data accumulates on our servers - each copy request is stateless</li>
            <li><strong>Right to Deletion:</strong> You can request deletion of your copy tracking record anytime (see Section 10: Your Privacy Rights)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5A.4 Secure Development Practices</h3>

        <h4>Code Security</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Open Source Transparency:</strong> All source code is publicly available on GitHub for security audits</li>
            <li><strong>No Obfuscation:</strong> Code is readable and auditable - no minification or obfuscation of Apps Script code</li>
            <li><strong>Input Validation:</strong> All user inputs are validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks</li>
            <li><strong>No eval() Usage:</strong> Capital Friends does not use <code>eval()</code> or <code>Function()</code> constructors that could execute arbitrary code</li>
            <li><strong>XSS Prevention:</strong> HTML output is sanitized to prevent cross-site scripting attacks</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Dependency Management</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Minimal External Dependencies:</strong> Uses only trusted CDN libraries (Tailwind CSS from cdn.tailwindcss.com, Fuse.js from cdn.jsdelivr.net)</li>
            <li><strong>No npm Packages:</strong> Does not use unvetted third-party npm modules</li>
            <li><strong>Subresource Integrity (SRI):</strong> External scripts loaded with integrity hashes where supported</li>
            <li><strong>Google-Only APIs:</strong> Server-side code uses only Google's built-in Apps Script services (no external API keys or credentials)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5A.5 Infrastructure Security (Google Cloud Platform)</h3>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p><strong>Security Summary:</strong> Your sensitive financial data is protected by Google's enterprise-grade encryption (AES-256 at rest, TLS 1.2+ in transit), ownership-based access controls (zero developer access after transfer), minimal OAuth scopes (only 3 scopes: gmail.send, script.scriptapp, script.container.ui), and Google Cloud Platform's SOC 2/ISO 27001 certified infrastructure. We implement defense-in-depth security with open-source code transparency, input validation, and no long-term data retention.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>6. Data Sharing & Third Parties</h2>
        <p><strong>We do NOT sell, rent, or share your information with any third parties.</strong></p>

        <p>The only "sharing" that occurs is:</p>

        <h3>6.1 Google Services (Required)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Your data is processed by Google Apps Script (Google's platform)</li>
            <li>Your copy is stored in Google Drive</li>
            <li>Emails are sent via Gmail (from YOUR account, not ours)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This is unavoidable because Capital Friends is built on Google Workspace. By using Capital Friends, you're subject to <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google's Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

        <h3>6.2 No Marketing, No Analytics, No Advertising</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>We don't use Google Analytics or any tracking pixels</li>
            <li>We don't integrate with advertising networks</li>
            <li>We don't send marketing emails (the only emails are security reminders from YOUR copy to YOU)</li>
            <li>We don't share data with data brokers or marketing companies</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>6.3 Open Source Code</h3>
        <p>Capital Friends is open source on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/jagadeeshkmanne/capital-friends" target="_blank">https://github.com/jagadeeshkmanne/capital-friends</a></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Anyone can review our code to verify our privacy claims</li>
            <li>The Apps Script code in your copy is visible to you (Tools → Script editor)</li>
            <li>No hidden functionality or data collection</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. Your Email Reports (Important Clarification)</h2>
        <p>Capital Friends includes an optional feature that sends daily security reminder emails. Here's how it works:</p>

        <h3>These Emails Are Sent BY You, TO You</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The Apps Script code in YOUR copy uses YOUR Gmail account to send emails</li>
            <li>The emails are sent TO your own email address (the one you used to request the copy)</li>
            <li>We (the developers) are NOT involved in this email process</li>
            <li>We don't see the email content, recipients, or delivery status</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What Triggers These Emails</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>You can set up time-based triggers in YOUR copy (via the "⚙️ Setup Email Reports" menu)</li>
            <li>The triggers run under YOUR Google account permissions</li>
            <li>The email content is based on YOUR questionnaire answers</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>You Can Disable This Anytime</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Go to your Google Account → Security → Manage third-party access</li>
            <li>Or delete the triggers from YOUR sheet's Apps Script project</li>
            <li>Or simply ignore the menu item and never set up email reports</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>8. Google Apps Script Permissions (OAuth Scopes)</h2>
        <p>When you create your copy and start using features, Google will ask you to authorize specific permissions. These are called "OAuth scopes" and control what the Apps Script code can do within YOUR Google account.</p>

        <h3>8.1 Required Scopes</h3>
        <p>Capital Friends requires these 3 OAuth scopes to function. Google will show an authorization screen requesting these permissions:</p>

        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Scope</th>
                    <th>Permission Name</th>
                    <th>Why Needed</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td><code>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.send</code></td>
                    <td>Send email on your behalf</td>
                    <td>Sends optional security reminders and weekly portfolio summary emails to your email address. No inbox access - only sends emails. All emails are sent from YOUR Gmail account to YOU. Disable anytime in Settings menu.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><code>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/script.scriptapp</code></td>
                    <td>Manage your Apps Script triggers</td>
                    <td>Installs optional time-based triggers for automated email reports and reminders. Allows you to manage/delete triggers through the Settings menu. Users have full control over all automation.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><code>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/script.container.ui</code></td>
                    <td>Display and run third-party web content in prompts and sidebars inside Google applications</td>
                    <td>Displays custom dialog boxes and sidebars for features like adding investments, managing portfolios, viewing dashboards, and generating reports. Enables the interactive user interface within the Google Sheets environment.</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <h3>8.2 External JavaScript/CSS Libraries (No OAuth Scope Required)</h3>
        <p>Capital Friends HTML dialogs load some external libraries directly in your browser:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Tailwind CSS:</strong> UI styling framework from cdn.tailwindcss.com</li>
            <li><strong>Fuse.js:</strong> Fuzzy search library from cdn.jsdelivr.net for fund/stock search</li>
            <li><strong>Google Fonts:</strong> Inter font from fonts.googleapis.com</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Important:</strong> These resources are loaded by YOUR BROWSER (client-side), not by Apps Script server-side code. No OAuth scope is required because the browser makes these HTTP requests directly, just like visiting any website.</p>

        <h3>8.3 Important Notes About OAuth</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Progressive Authorization:</strong> You're only asked for permissions when you actually use features that need them</li>
            <li><strong>Runs Under YOUR Account:</strong> The Apps Script code executes using YOUR Google account authentication, not ours</li>
            <li><strong>You Control Access:</strong> You can revoke these permissions anytime from your Google Account settings (Security → Third-party apps)</li>
            <li><strong>After Ownership Transfer:</strong> The code runs entirely in your copy - we have no access to your data even with these scopes</li>
            <li><strong>Time-Based Triggers:</strong> Email schedule triggers run under YOUR account permissions and can be deleted from Extensions → Apps Script → Triggers</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>9. Master Database Access (IMPORTRANGE)</h2>
        <p>Capital Friends uses Google Sheets' IMPORTRANGE formula to connect to public reference databases. This is different from OAuth permissions.</p>

        <h3>9.1 What are the Master Databases?</h3>
        <p>Your spreadsheet includes two sheets that import reference data from public databases:</p>

        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Sheet Name</th>
                    <th>Database ID</th>
                    <th>Contains</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>MutualFundData</strong></td>
                    <td><code>1pSvGDFTgcCkW6Fk9P2mZ5FSpROVClz7Vu0sW9JnPz9s</code></td>
                    <td>1000+ mutual fund names, AMC names, fund categories, and codes for search/lookup functionality</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>StockMasterData</strong></td>
                    <td>Public stock database</td>
                    <td>1000+ NSE and BSE stock symbols, company names, and ISIN codes for stock lookup</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <h3>9.2 IMPORTRANGE Permission (Required)</h3>
        <p>When you first open the MutualFundData or StockMasterData sheets, you'll see a <code>#REF!</code> error with the message: "You need permission to access this external data."</p>

        <p><strong>What you need to do:</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Click the <strong>"Allow access"</strong> button that appears in the cell</li>
            <li>This grants permission for YOUR spreadsheet to read data from OUR public master databases</li>
            <li>Data will then load and update automatically</li>
        </ol>

        <p><strong>Important clarifications:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>One-way connection:</strong> Data flows FROM master database TO your sheet only. Your financial data NEVER goes to the master database.</li>
            <li><strong>Read-only access:</strong> The master databases are publicly shared as "Anyone with link can view" - they contain NO user information</li>
            <li><strong>Reference data only:</strong> These databases contain publicly available mutual fund and stock information (names, symbols, codes), not your personal holdings or values</li>
            <li><strong>Updated automatically:</strong> Master databases refresh daily from public sources (AMFI, NSE, BSE APIs), keeping fund/stock information current</li>
            <li><strong>No privacy risk:</strong> IMPORTRANGE cannot access your financial data or other sheets in your Drive</li>
            <li><strong>Can be revoked:</strong> You can remove access by deleting the MutualFundData and StockMasterData sheets (though you'll lose search functionality)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>9.3 Why This is Safe</h3>
        <p>The IMPORTRANGE formula is a standard Google Sheets feature that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Only allows reading data from the specified external spreadsheet</li>
            <li>Cannot write data back to the source</li>
            <li>Cannot access other sheets in your Drive</li>
            <li>Is visible and auditable - you can see the formula in cell A1 of each data sheet</li>
            <li>Is completely separate from OAuth permissions - it's a spreadsheet-level permission, not an API permission</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>You can verify the master databases are public:</strong> Visit the spreadsheet IDs listed above in any browser (while logged into Google) to see they're shared publicly with view-only access.</p>

        <h2>10. Cookies & Tracking Technologies</h2>
        <p><strong>Capital Friends does NOT use cookies.</strong></p>

        <p>Our web app (the initial page where you request a copy) is a simple Google Apps Script web app that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Does not set any cookies in your browser</li>
            <li>Does not use localStorage or sessionStorage</li>
            <li>Does not include third-party tracking scripts</li>
            <li>Does not use fingerprinting or device tracking</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Google's Apps Script platform may set its own session cookies for authentication purposes, but we don't control or access these.</p>

        <h2>9. Data Retention & Deletion</h2>

        <h3>9.1 No Data Retention by Us</h3>
        <p>Capital Friends does NOT retain your data after ownership transfer:</p>

            <li>Your email is only used during the ownership transfer process</li>
            <li>Questionnaire answers are stored only in YOUR copy</li>
            <li>We have no centralized database or tracking system</li>
            <li>Nothing to delete - your data never reaches our systems</li>
        </ul>
