    <p class="action">[TITLE CARD: Auto Rebalancing & Asset Allocation — Never Invest Blindly Again! | FREE Portfolio Tracker Google Sheets]</p>

    <p style="color:#888;font-size:12px;"><i>In previous videos we set up portfolios, recorded transactions, understood P&L, and used ATH tracking for buying opportunities. Now let's make sure our portfolio stays balanced.</i></p>

    <p>Hi everyone. This is the most powerful feature of Capital Friends. Most investors get this wrong — they invest equally every month without checking if their portfolio is still balanced.</p>

    <p class="subsection">WHAT WE'LL COVER</p>
    <p>1. Why asset allocation matters — target vs current</p>
    <p>2. Rebalance threshold — when it activates</p>
    <p>3. Rebalance SIP — smarter monthly investment split</p>
    <p>4. Rebalance Lumpsum — where to put extra money</p>
    <p>5. Buy/Sell — instant rebalancing with Switch</p>
    <p>6. Manage Portfolio Allocation — visual view</p>
    <p>7. Fund Composition Breakdown — equity/debt/market cap split</p>
    <p>Let me show you why this matters and how Capital Friends solves it.</p>

    <p class="subsection">LIVE DEMO</p>

    <p class="subsection">WHY ASSET ALLOCATION MATTERS</p>

    <p>Let's say you set your portfolio to 50-50 between two funds. That was your plan. But the market doesn't care about your plan. Different funds grow at different speeds.</p>

    <p class="action">[Show a portfolio sheet — point to current allocation column]</p>
    <p>Look at this portfolio. Target was 50-50. But one fund grew faster than the other. So now one fund is around 41% and the other is 59%. The carefully planned allocation has drifted.</p>
    <p class="action">[Point to target vs current allocation columns — explain the drift]</p>

    <p>If you just keep investing equally, the imbalance stays. Capital Friends tells you — invest <span class="hl">more</span> in the underweight fund and <span class="hl">less</span> in the overweight fund.</p>

    <p class="subsection">REBALANCE THRESHOLD</p>

    <p>When creating a portfolio, you set a rebalance threshold — say 5%. This means:</p>
    <p>If the gap between target and current is <span class="hl">less than 5%</span> → normal SIP (split equally)</p>
    <p>If the gap is <span class="hl">more than 5%</span> → rebalancing activates</p>

    <p>In this example, the gap is about 9% which is > 5%. So rebalancing is active. Let me show you the three rebalancing columns.</p>

    <p class="subsection">COLUMN L — REBALANCE SIP</p>

    <p>Say your monthly SIP target is ₹10,000. Normally you split it equally. But rebalancing says:</p>
    <p class="action">[Point to Column L — Rebalance SIP. Explain: the underweight fund gets a bigger share of SIP, the overweight fund gets less. Instead of equal split, it adjusts to bring you back to target]</p>

    <p>So instead of equal split, the rebalanced SIP tells you to invest more in the underweight fund and less in the overweight one.</p>

    <p>Over a few months of doing this, your portfolio gradually comes back to 50-50. No selling needed — just smarter SIP allocation.</p>

    <p class="subsection">COLUMN N — REBALANCE LUMPSUM</p>

    <p>If you have extra money to invest right now as a lumpsum, this column tells you exactly where to put it.</p>
    <p class="action">[Point to Column N — Rebalance Lumpsum. Explain: it shows the exact rupee amount each fund needs to reach its target. Positive = buy more, Negative = already over target, don't buy]</p>

    <p>So if you have a lumpsum to invest, this column tells you exactly how to split it — or put it all in the underweight fund.</p>

    <p class="subsection">COLUMN O — BUY/SELL</p>

    <p>This column shows the exact rupee amount to buy or sell for <span class="hl">instant perfect rebalancing</span>.</p>
    <p class="action">[Point to Column O — Buy/Sell. Explain: one fund shows BUY ₹X, the other shows SELL ₹X. If you sell the overweight and buy the underweight — that is a Switch!]</p>

    <p>Go to <span class="fn">Mutual Funds → Switch Funds</span> and do the switch. After that, both funds will be at exactly their target allocation.</p>

    <p>And important — this switch does NOT create realized P&L. The money stays in the market. You are just rebalancing internally, not taking any money out.</p>

    <p class="subsection">WHEN THRESHOLD IS NOT BREACHED</p>

    <p>What if one fund is at 48% and the other at 52%? The gap is only 2%. Since 2% < 5% threshold, rebalancing does NOT activate. The sheet shows normal SIP — equal split. This prevents unnecessary trading for small fluctuations.</p>

    <p>You can change the threshold in Edit Portfolio. 3% = more frequent rebalancing, 10% = less frequent. 5% is a good default.</p>

    <p class="subsection">MANAGE PORTFOLIO ALLOCATION</p>

    <p class="action">[Click Mutual Funds → Manage Portfolio Allocation]</p>
    <p>This is a nice visual view showing all your funds with their current and target allocations. You can adjust target percentages from here too. If you add a third fund later and want 40-30-30 instead of 50-50, change it here.</p>

    <p class="subsection">BEST PRACTICES</p>

    <p>1. Check rebalancing columns once a month when you do your SIP</p>
    <p>2. If columns show rebalanced SIP — follow those amounts instead of equal split</p>
    <p>3. Only do a Switch (sell one, buy another) if the imbalance is very large (15%+)</p>
    <p>4. Don't rebalance daily — once a month or quarter is enough</p>
    <p>5. Check ATH columns (R & S) — if a fund is 20% below ATH AND underweight, that is a double signal to buy more</p>

    <p>This single feature replaces paid robo-advisors. You get it free in Capital Friends.</p>

    <p class="subsection">FUND COMPOSITION BREAKDOWN</p>

    <p>Now let me show you another important feature. Do you know the real composition of your portfolio? Most people think "I invest in 2 equity funds, so I am 100% equity." That is wrong. Your flexi cap fund might be 65% equity and 35% cash/debt. Capital Friends helps you see the full picture.</p>

    <p class="action">[Click Mutual Funds → Fund Composition Breakdown]</p>

    <p class="action">[Select a fund from dropdown]</p>
    <p>Enter the breakdown for each fund:</p>
    <p><span class="fn">Equity %</span> | <span class="fn">Debt %</span> | <span class="fn">Cash/Others %</span></p>
    <p>Within equity: <span class="fn">Large Cap %</span> | <span class="fn">Mid Cap %</span> | <span class="fn">Small Cap %</span></p>
    <p>Click Save. Do this for each fund in your portfolio.</p>

    <p>Now Capital Friends calculates your <span class="hl">overall portfolio composition</span> based on how much money is in each fund — total equity, debt, cash split, and within equity: large, mid, small cap breakdown.</p>

    <p><span class="hl">Where to get this data?</span> Go to your AMC's website. Download the monthly factsheet. It shows the exact breakdown. Update this once every 3 months.</p>

    <p>This information shows in the <span class="fn">email report</span> and <span class="fn">dashboard</span> — complete asset allocation of your portfolio. If you see 80% small cap, you know your risk is very high and you should rebalance.</p>

    <p>Asset allocation, rebalancing, and fund composition — three features that replace paid robo-advisors. You get them free in Capital Friends.
